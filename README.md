Overview: Phrase Frequency Counter from Text Files
This C++ program reads a text file, cleans and processes the words, combines adjacent words into phrases of a user-specified length (1â€“5), and counts the frequency of each unique phrase. It then writes these phrases and their frequencies to an output file in a sorted format.
